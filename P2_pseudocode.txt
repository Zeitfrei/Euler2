Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.


even valued terms smaller than 4 million in array
sum of elements in array


somehow save only the 2 predecessors

start 1 and 2

int prepre, pre, current;
int evenfibonacci[];

array???? dont know how many elements - dog damn data structures

current = 0;
prepre = 1;
pre = 2;

evenfibancci.add(pre);

while(current < 4000000)
{
	current = prepre+pre;
	prepre = pre;
	pre = current;

	if(current % 2 == 0)
		evenfibonacci.add(current);
}
